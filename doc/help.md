## How to use PWA-Chat

### Sign up

To begin, open the app on your device or visit the app's website. Once you're there, look for the sign-up button or link, usually located on the home screen or navigation menu. Click on the sign-up button to proceed.

You'll be directed to the registration page, where you'll find a form asking for your information. Start by choosing a username. This will be your unique identifier in the app, so pick a name that represents you or is easy to remember.

After selecting a username, create a strong and secure password. Remember to make it at least eight characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This will help protect your account from unauthorized access.

Next, provide a nickname. This is the name that other users will see when you chat with them. It can be a fun or creative name that reflects your personality or interests.

Now, enter your full name in the designated field. This will help other users recognize you and make the conversations more personalized.

Before moving forward, double-check all the information you entered to ensure accuracy and completeness. It's important to verify that there are no spelling mistakes or typos.

Once you're confident that all the information is correct, click the sign-up button to complete the registration process. The app will then process your information and verify its validity.

If everything goes smoothly, you'll be automatically redirected to the chat page. Here, you can start exploring and interacting with other users, sharing thoughts, and engaging in conversations.

### Sign in

First, open the app on your device or visit the app's website. Once you're on the app's interface, locate the sign-in button or link. It's usually positioned prominently on the home screen or in the navigation menu.

Click on the sign-in button to proceed to the login page. On this page, you'll find a login form prompting you to enter your username and password. These credentials are necessary to verify your identity and grant you access to the app's chat functionality.

Start by entering your username in the designated field. This username serves as a unique identifier associated with your account. Take a moment to ensure that you type it accurately to avoid any login issues.

Next, provide your password in the corresponding field. Ensure that your password is entered correctly, as it is case-sensitive. Make sure you're using the correct capitalization and include any special characters or numbers if applicable.

Double-check the information you entered to ensure accuracy. Verifying your credentials before proceeding helps prevent any login errors or unnecessary frustration.

Once you're confident that your username and password are correct, it's time to click the sign-in button. This action triggers the app to process your login information and authenticate your account.

If all goes well, the app will validate your credentials and redirect you to the chat page. You've successfully signed in to the app and can now start engaging with other users in the chat section.

### Write a Message

Once you're on the chat page of the app, locate the textbox at the bottom of the screen. This is where you can enter your message to send it to others.

Click on the textbox to activate it and begin typing your message. You can write anything you want to communicate with other users in the chat.

Take your time to compose your message, ensuring that it conveys your intended meaning or information clearly.

After you have finished typing your message, review it for any errors or revisions you may want to make. This can help you ensure that your message is accurate and easy to understand.

Once you're satisfied with your message, direct your attention to the right side of the input area. You'll find a send button positioned there.

Click on the send button to transmit your message. The app will process your input and send the message to the intended recipients.

Wait for a moment to allow the app to deliver your message. This may take a few seconds depending on the app's speed and network connection.

Once your message has been successfully sent, it will appear in the chat window along with any other messages exchanged in the conversation.

You've successfully written and sent a message using the textbox and the send button. You can continue engaging in the chat by repeating these steps whenever you want to send another message.

Remember to respect others and follow any guidelines or rules set by the app or chat community to ensure a positive and enjoyable experience for everyone.

### Send a Photo

Start by accessing the chat page within the app. Once you're on the chat screen, locate the input bar positioned at the bottom of the screen. Look for a camera icon within the input bar.

Click on the camera icon to activate the camera feature. This will open the camera interface within the app.

If you haven't granted access to the camera before, you may be prompted to allow the app access to your device's camera. In such a case, a pop-up message will appear asking for your permission.

Grant the app access to your camera by clicking on the appropriate button in the pop-up message. This step is necessary to use the camera feature within the app.

Once access is granted, you will see the camera interface on your screen. Use the camera viewfinder to compose the photo and adjust the focus, if necessary. When you're ready to capture the photo, locate the shutter icon below the image preview.

Click on the shutter icon to take the photo. The app will capture the image and display it in the preview area for you to review.

Review the photo you just took to ensure it meets your expectations. If you're satisfied with the photo, proceed to the next step.

Now, shift your attention to the right side of the bottom input bar, where you'll find a send button.

Click on the send button to attach and send the photo you just captured. The app will process the image and send it as a message to the intended recipients in the chat.

Wait for a moment to allow the app to complete the sending process. Depending on the image size and network connection, this may take a few seconds.

You have successfully taken a photo using the camera feature, attached it to your message, and sent it to the chat. The photo will now appear in the conversation along with any other messages exchanged.

Remember to respect others' privacy and follow any guidelines or rules set by the app or chat community when sharing photos.
